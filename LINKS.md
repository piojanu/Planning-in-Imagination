# Lectures

* [Deep RL Bootcamp Lecture 9 Model-based Reinforcement Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC2a7M9voYU) - really good overview of model-based RL. It can be hard to understand at first watch (and second, and third...), but it has a lot of high value references, worth diving into them to better understand topic. Lecture agenda:  
  1. Why use model-based reinforcement learning?
  2. Main model-based RL approaches
  3. Using local models & guided policy search
  4. Handling high-dimensional observations
