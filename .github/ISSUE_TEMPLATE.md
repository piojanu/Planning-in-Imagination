## Your issue should contain:

### What the issue is all about?
Set [SMART](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm) goal, tell what is the problem *(in case of e.g. bug)*, what should be checked *(in case of e.g. experiment)* or **what are the questions to answer** *(in case of e.g. research, study)*. It's really important to know why we do something, so we can make the wisest possible investment of our time and energy in issues which are worth effort.

### What is the definition of done?
It should always be clear, where is the end of the work. It shouldn't be changed often too! If scope changes or more work needs to be done, it's better to end current issues and start new one, so we don't end up with never ending story (or issue :smile:).

### Next steps...
Clear next physical steps to push issue forward e.g. "Implement 'Dog' class [...]", "Contact Mark to [...]", "Find paper about [...]", "Read/Watch [...]". You can **sometimes** omit this part if next steps are obvious from "How?" section *(e.g. you have list of papers to read)* or you really don't want to/can't suggest first steps to solution.
